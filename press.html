								<h2 id="privacy">Privacy Notice</h2>
								<p>
									Your privacy is very important to us. Please read this policy carefully. The policy describes how we use and protect any information that you give us by using this website. In case you have any concerns or questions you can always get in touch with us.
								</p>

								<p>
									Note: We change this notice from time to time to ensure that it is accurate and up to date. This particular notice was published on November 13th, 2015.
								</p>

								<h2>Information We Collect About You</h2>
								<h3>Information you give to us directly</h3>
								<p>
									We have a contact form on the website that you can use to get in touch with us. On that form we ask for your name, first name, and Email address. In addition, you provide us with any information you choose to include in the subject line and the message body. Please never include sensitive information (e.g credit card or personal health information) in the form.
								</p>
								<h3>Information that is collected automatically</h3>
								<div class="italic">Analytics Information</div>

								<p>
									We may directly collect analytics data or use third-party services to measure traffic to our site and usage trends on our site. These tools collect information that is shared by your desktop or mobile browser. We may, for instance, collect information on which pages you visit on our site, how long you spend on our site and whether you access it from a desktop or a mobile browser.
								</p>
								<p>
									We use analytics information in aggregate form so that no individual user can reasonably be identified. For instance, we may learn that 30% of our traffic comes from IP Addresses in the USA but we cannot see what the individual IP Addresses are and where exactly they are located.
								</p>

								<div id="cookies" class="italic">Cookies</div>

								<p>
									A cookie is a small string of text that asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
								</p>

								<p>
									Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
								</p>

								<p>
									Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. The website will still work perfectly fine if you decide to decline cookies and we will never be the wiser.
								</p>
								
								<h2>What We Do With Your Information</h2>

								<p>
									We use your information exclusively for the purposes of correspondence with you and to improve our service and website. We do not sell, rent, or share your information to or with anyone outside Psych Media, LLC or any third party services. Here is what you can expect from us:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>If there are major news we might send out a promotional Email to share them with you.</li>
									<li>We might also reach out to you for research purposes about our service and product.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>

								<p>
									We take data security very seriously. To ensure that your data is safe with us from unauthorized access or disclosure we have suitable, industry-standard physical, electronic and procedural measures in place. We train our staff to make sure they know how to stay safe and how to handle your private information.
								</p>

								<h2>Controlling your Data</h2>

								<p>
									If you wish for us to delete the data that you have provided us with, please get in touch with us. We cannot delete data that we have obtained through analytics tools as we cannot identify your unique information within the dataset.
								</p>

								<p>
									You can also delete any information from our website stored in your browser by going to your browser’s privacy settings and delete all website information or search for our website and delete that information specifically.
								</p>

								<p>
									If you don’t want to receive Emails from us anymore let us know and we will take your address off the list. Unless you explicitly tell us to delete your data, we will keep your information on file in case we need to get in touch with you in the future.
								</p>

								<h2>Online Privacy Policy Only</h2>

								<p>
									This privacy policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website and regarding information shared and/or collected there. This policy does not apply to any information collected offline or via channels other than this website.
								</p>

								<h2>Consent</h2>

								<p>
