						<h3>The Problem</h3>
						<p>Current modes of adolescent mental health care aren't working.</p>
						<p>20% of American teenagers have a diagnosable mental health disorder. That's 1 in 5!  But only about a third of those who need help get any treatment at all. And even though more than $8.9 billion is spent on mental health care for Americans under 18 each year, most available treatments are inadequate, ineffective, and outdated.</p>
						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<p>Build tool to engage young people in their own mental health care. Have that tool exist on the mobile devices where they spend most of their time.</p>

								<h3>Information that is collected automatically</h3>
								<div class="italic">Analytics Information</div>

								<p>
									We may directly collect analytics data or use third-party services to measure traffic to our site and usage trends on our site. These tools collect information that is shared by your desktop or mobile browser. We may, for instance, collect information on which pages you visit on our site, how long you spend on our site and whether you access it from a desktop or a mobile browser.
								</p>
								<p>
									We use analytics information in aggregate form so that no individual user can reasonably be identified. For instance, we may learn that 30% of our traffic comes from IP Addresses in the USA but we cannot see what the individual IP Addresses are and where exactly they are located.
								</p>

								<div id="cookies" class="italic">Cookies</div>

								<p>
									A cookie is a small string of text that asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual.

								</p>

								<p>
									Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
								</p>

								<p>
									Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. The website will still work perfectly fine if you decide to decline cookies and we will never be the wiser.

								</p>

								<h2>Controlling your Data</h2>

								<p>
									If you wish for us to delete the data that you have provided us with, please get in touch with us. We cannot delete data that we have obtained through analytics tools as we cannot identify your unique information within the dataset.
