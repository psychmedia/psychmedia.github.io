						<h3>The Problem</h3>
						<p>Current modes of adolescent mental health care aren't working.</p>
						<p>20% of American teenagers have a diagnosable mental health disorder. That's 1 in 5!  But only about a third of those who need help get any treatment at all. And even though more than $8.9 billion is spent on mental health care for Americans under 18 each year, most available treatments are inadequate, ineffective, and outdated.</p>
						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<p>Build tool to engage young people in their own mental health care. Have that tool exist on the mobile devices where they spend most of their time.</p>

								<p>
									Your privacy is very important to us. Please read this policy carefully. The policy describes how we use and protect any information that you give us by using this website. In case you have any concerns or questions you can always get in touch with us.
								</p>

								<p>
									Note: We change this notice from time to time to ensure that it is accurate and up to date. This particular notice was published on November 13th, 2015.
								</p>

								<h2>Information We Collect About You</h2>
								<h3>Information you give to us directly</h3>
								<p>
									We have a contact form on the website that you can use to get in touch with us. On that form we ask for your name, first name, and Email address.

Please never include sensitive information (e.g credit card or personal health information) in the form.
								</p>
								<h3>Information that is collected automatically</h3>
								<div class="italic">Analytics Information</div>

								<p>
									We may directly collect analytics data or use third-party services to measure traffic to our site and usage trends on our site. These tools collect information that is shared by your desktop or mobile browser. We may, for instance, collect information on which pages you visit on our site, how long you spend on our site and whether you access it from a desktop or a mobile browser.
								</p>
								<p>
									We use analytics information in aggregate form so that no individual user can reasonably be identified. For instance, we may learn that 30% of our traffic comes from IP Addresses in the USA but we cannot see what the individual IP Addresses are and where exactly they are located.
								</p>

								<div id="cookies" class="italic">Cookies</div>

								<p>
									A cookie is a small string of text that asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
								</p>

								<p>
									Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
								</p>

								<p>
									Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. The website will still work perfectly fine if you decide to decline cookies and we will never be the wiser.
								</p>

									<li>We might also reach out to you for research purposes about our service and product.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>

									We take data security very seriously. To ensure that your data is safe with us from unauthorized access or disclosure we have suitable, industry-standard physical, electronic and procedural measures in place.

								</p>

								<h2>Controlling your Data</h2>

								<p>
									If you wish for us to delete the data that you have provided us with, please get in touch with us. We cannot delete data that we have obtained through analytics tools as we cannot identify your unique information within the dataset.
								</p>

								<p>
									You can also delete any information from our website stored in your browser by going to your browser’s privacy settings and delete all website information or search for our website and delete that information specifically.
